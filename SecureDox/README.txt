This tool creates a random passphrase of 120 characters and uses it  to encrypt a data file using AES-256-CBC. You can then enter the public key of the intended recipient and this will encrypt the passphrase. A folder containing the encrypted passphrase and data file is made. This can be sent to the recipient, who can then use their private key to decrypt the 120 character passphrase, and there-for decrypt the datafile.
